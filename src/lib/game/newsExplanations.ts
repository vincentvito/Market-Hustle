  // --- Chain 1: geo_trade_war (US-India) ---
  "US-INDIA TARIFF ESCALATION: WHITE HOUSE THREATENS 200% DUTIES ON INDIAN TECH EXPORTS": "Trade war rhetoric hits emerging markets hardest. India's massive tech outsourcing industry faces existential threat. Markets sell off on globalization fears - if the world's two largest democracies can't trade, nobody's safe. Gold rises as a hedge against economic fragmentation.",

  "FULL TRADE WAR: US SLAPS 200% TARIFFS ON INDIA - INDIA RETALIATES WITH TECH BAN": "A full bilateral trade war is devastating for both economies. India banning US tech means American firms lose 1.4 billion consumers. US tariffs spike consumer electronics prices. Supply chains scramble, emerging markets collapse on contagion fears, and gold soars as the global order fractures.",

  "PARTIAL DEAL: US AND INDIA AGREE TO LIMITED TARIFFS, MARKETS EXHALE": "A partial deal is the market's favorite outcome - just enough resolution to remove tail risk. Limited tariffs mean manageable costs, not existential ones. Emerging markets bounce on relief, the dollar stabilizes, and risk appetite returns. Wall Street loves a compromise.",

  "TRADE BREAKTHROUGH: INDIA OPENS MARKETS, US DROPS ALL THREATS": "Full trade normalization is rocket fuel for markets. India opening its markets means access to the fastest-growing large economy. Tech stocks rally on new consumer pools, emerging markets surge, and the dollar strengthens as global trade flows increase. Free trade wins again.",

  "INDIA PLAYS WILDCARD: JOINS BRICS TRADE BLOC, DUMPS DOLLAR FOR SETTLEMENTS": "India abandoning dollar settlement is a body blow to US reserve currency status. If the world's 5th largest economy trades in yuan and rupees, dollar demand structurally falls. Gold and crypto surge as alternative stores of value. This is de-dollarization going from theory to practice.",

  // --- Chain 2: geo_africa_coup (Lithium Mine) ---
  "MILITARY COUP IN PROGRESS: WORLD'S 2ND LARGEST LITHIUM MINE SURROUNDED BY TANKS": "Resource-rich nations are always coup targets. Lithium is the new oil - control the mine, control the EV supply chain. Markets price in immediate supply disruption. Lithium spikes, EV stocks drop on cost fears, and defense names rally on geopolitical instability.",

  "JUNTA SEIZES LITHIUM MINE: NATIONALIZES ALL FOREIGN ASSETS, EXPELS WORKERS": "Nationalization is every mining investor's nightmare. Foreign companies lose billions in stranded assets. Lithium supply drops overnight, sending prices parabolic. EV makers scramble for alternative sources. This is exactly why mining companies demand political risk premiums.",

  "COUP SUCCEEDS BUT JUNTA HONORS MINING CONTRACTS - SUPPLY CONTINUES": "Military juntas often keep resource contracts intact - they need the revenue. Markets breathe a sigh of relief. Lithium normalizes, EV stocks recover, and the lesson is clear: follow the money. Whoever's in charge still needs to sell the lithium.",

  "COUP FAILS: LOYALIST FORCES RETAKE MINE, DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT RESTORED": "Democracy wins and markets love certainty. The mine resumes full production, lithium supply stabilizes, and foreign investors get their assets back. Emerging markets rally on restored rule of law. Political risk premiums contract across the resource sector.",

  "CHINA DEPLOYS \"PEACEKEEPERS\" TO MINE - SECURES EXCLUSIVE SUPPLY DEAL": "China's resource diplomacy strikes again. By securing exclusive access, China locks Western EV makers out of critical supply. Lithium available to Chinese firms but not Western ones creates a two-tier market. This is resource colonialism with extra steps, and it reshapes the entire EV supply chain.",

  // --- Chain 3: agri_bee_collapse (Pollinator Crisis) ---
  "POLLINATOR EXTINCTION ALERT: 80% OF US BEE COLONIES FOUND DEAD IN MASS DIE-OFF": "Bees pollinate 35% of global food crops. Losing 80% of colonies threatens the entire agricultural food chain. Wheat and food commodities spike on crop failure fears. Biotech rallies on potential solutions. This is an ecological crisis with immediate economic consequences.",

  "BEE APOCALYPSE CONFIRMED: USDA DECLARES AGRICULTURAL EMERGENCY, CROPS FAILING": "An agricultural emergency means federal intervention, crop insurance payouts, and food price spikes. Wheat and commodities soar as yields collapse. Grocery stocks fall on margin compression from rising input costs. The food supply chain is only as strong as its smallest pollinator.",

  "CONGRESS PASSES $300B BIOTECH RESCUE: GENE-ENGINEERED POLLINATORS FUNDED": "A $300B federal program is a massive stimulus for biotech and agricultural tech companies. NASDAQ rallies on government-funded R&D spending. Food prices stabilize on the promise of a solution, though delivery is years away. When the government writes checks this big, someone profits enormously.",

  "BEE DIE-OFF CONTAINED: PESTICIDE IDENTIFIED AND BANNED, RECOVERY EXPECTED": "Identifying the cause is half the battle. Banning the pesticide means colonies can recover, food production normalizes, and ag commodity prices retreat. Pesticide makers take a hit, but the broader market rallies on removed tail risk. Simple problems with simple solutions are the best kind.",

  "CONSUMER CREDIT CRISIS: BANKS TIGHTEN LENDING, RECESSION FEARS SPIKE": "When banks tighten lending, they create the recession they fear. Less credit means less spending, less spending means less revenue, less revenue means more layoffs. It's a vicious cycle. Stocks sell off broadly, gold rises, and bond yields fall as investors price in rate cuts to fight the downturn.",

  "FED EMERGENCY BACKSTOP: CREDIT FACILITY PREVENTS CONTAGION": "The Fed steps in as lender of last resort - again. Emergency facilities prevent bank failures but create moral hazard.

This is the single most disruptive scientific discovery in financial history.",

  "GOLD SYNTHESIS CONFIRMED BUT COSTS $50,000/OZ - COMMERCIALLY USELESS": "The physics works but the economics don't. At $50,000/oz production cost, traditional mining is still far cheaper.

  "JAPAN RESTARTS 12 NUCLEAR REACTORS": "Japan going back to nuclear after Fukushima is a massive signal. Twelve reactors need fuel - that's a huge uranium demand shock. The global uranium market is already tight. Oil weakens because nuclear displaces gas and coal in baseload power generation.",

  "URANIUM MINE COLLAPSE IN KAZAKHSTAN — GLOBAL SUPPLY CRUNCH": "Kazakhstan produces 40% of the world's uranium. A mine collapse takes supply offline immediately in an already tight market. Uranium prices spike on scarcity. Unlike oil, there's no strategic reserve to release. Gold rises sympathetically on commodity supply fears.",

Emerging markets suffer because Apple's massive supply chain runs through Asia.",

  "AI CHIP SHORTAGE HALTS DATA CENTER BUILDS": "AI runs on chips, and chips are in short supply. When data center builds pause, the entire AI growth narrative hits a speed bump.

  "WORLD'S FIRST BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACE LETS PARALYZED MAN WALK": "A paralyzed person walking via brain-computer interface is a medical moonshot realized. Biotech explodes because this validates neurotech as a platform — if you can make someone walk, you can treat Parkinson's, depression, PTSD. NASDAQ rallies on the broader tech implications. Tesla benefits from the Neuralink association.",

  "AI GENERATES $2B IN FAKE INVOICES — GLOBAL ACCOUNTING FIRMS COMPROMISED": "AI-generated fraud at industrial scale means every invoice, audit, and financial statement is now suspect.

Gold surges because inflation destroys purchasing power and savers need protection. BTC rallies on the same inflation hedge thesis. NASDAQ and emerging markets benefit from the GDP growth side. The debate is whether the growth is real or just nominal inflation.",

  "DOCKWORKERS STRIKE ENTERS WEEK 6 — SUPPLY CHAIN CRATERS, SHELVES EMPTY": "Six weeks of port shutdown has broken the supply chain completely. Oil spikes on rerouting costs, coffee surges because imports can't reach consumers. Gold rallies as economic chaos deepens.

  "FOMC MEETING CONCLUDES TOMORROW — RATE DECISION DUE": "FOMC rate decisions are the most important events on the financial calendar. The day before, markets are paralyzed by uncertainty. Traders reduce exposure, hedge positions, and wait. The outcome tomorrow will set the direction for weeks.",

  "NONFARM PAYROLLS DUE TOMORROW — ECONOMISTS SPLIT": "Jobs data is the Fed's north star for rate decisions. When economists are split, the market doesn't know which way to lean. Traders position cautiously, reducing risk exposure ahead of the number. Tomorrow's print could confirm or destroy the current macro narrative.",

  "CPI DATA RELEASE TOMORROW — INFLATION WATCH": "CPI is the single most market-moving data point right now. Everything - Fed policy, rate expectations, equity valuations - depends on where inflation is heading. Markets position defensively because a hot CPI print could upend the entire rate cut timeline.",

  "Q3 GDP REPORT DUE TOMORROW": "GDP tells you if the economy is growing or shrinking. A strong number supports stock earnings but might keep rates high. A weak number triggers recession fears but could bring rate cuts. Markets hedge both scenarios ahead of the release.",

  "BIG TECH EARNINGS WEEK: MEGA-CAPS REPORT TOMORROW": "Mega-cap earnings week is like the Super Bowl for markets. These companies represent trillions in market cap. Their results set the tone for the entire market. Traders position optimistically ahead of earnings but hedge their bets - nobody wants to be caught flat-footed.",

  // ===========================================
  // SCHEDULED EVENTS — OUTCOMES
  // ===========================================
  "FED CHAIR DOVISH: SIGNALS RATE CUTS ON HORIZON": "A dovish Fed Chair is the best news risk assets can hear. Rate cuts mean cheaper borrowing, higher asset valuations, and more money flowing into markets. Tech surges because future earnings are worth more at lower discount rates. Crypto rallies on liquidity expansion. Gold climbs as lower yields reduce the opportunity cost of holding it.",

  "FED CHAIR HAWKISH: HIGHER FOR LONGER": "Higher for longer is the market's nightmare scenario. It means expensive borrowing, compressed valuations, and less money flowing into risk assets. Tech sells off hardest because high rates crush the present value of future earnings. Gold rises on real yield concerns. Emerging markets suffer from dollar strength.",

  "FED CUTS RATES 50BPS — RISK ASSETS SURGE": "A 50bps cut is twice the normal pace — the Fed sees something worrying but is acting aggressively to prevent it. Markets celebrate the cheaper money. Altcoins lead the charge because they're the most leveraged bet on liquidity. Gold benefits from the lower real yields and weaker dollar. The Fed put is alive and well.",

  "FED HOLDS RATES STEADY — NO SURPRISES": "A hold was the consensus expectation, so markets barely react. The real information is in the statement and dot plots - traders will parse every word for hints about the next move. When the expected happens, the market exhales and carries on.",

  "FED SURPRISE HIKE — MARKETS REEL": "A surprise hike means the Fed knows something the market doesn't - and it's bad. Nobody was positioned for this. Stop losses trigger, margin calls go out, and the selling feeds on itself. Tech crashes. Crypto melts. Gold surges as the only asset that benefits from policy chaos.",

  "JOBS REPORT BLOWOUT: 400K ADDED, WAGES UP 5%": "400K jobs added is a blowout number that proves the economy is running hot. Consumers are employed and spending. Stocks rally on the strength. Oil rises on demand. But 5% wage growth is inflationary - the Fed might have to stay aggressive. Good news for Main Street, complicated for Wall Street.",

  "JOBS REPORT INLINE — MARKETS SHRUG": "An inline jobs report is a non-event. The market had already priced in this outcome, so there's nothing to react to. This is the Goldilocks scenario - the economy is doing exactly what everyone expected. Boring is sometimes the best outcome for markets.",

  "JOBS REPORT DISASTER: 50K ADDED, UNEMPLOYMENT SPIKES": "Only 50K jobs means the labor market is cracking. Companies are freezing hiring or laying off workers. Stocks crash on recession fears. But ironically, terrible economic data means the Fed has to cut rates - so bonds rally and some risk assets find support later. Gold and Bitcoin are the first beneficiaries of the fear trade.",

  "CPI COOLS TO 2.1% — SOFT LANDING NARRATIVE HOLDS": "2.1% CPI is almost exactly the Fed's target - mission accomplished. The soft landing thesis is validated. Rate cuts are coming and the economy didn't break to get there. Tech surges on lower future rates. Growth stocks celebrate. Gold falls because you don't need inflation hedges when inflation is tamed.",

  "CPI INLINE AT 3.2% — NO CHANGE IN OUTLOOK": "CPI at 3.2% matches expectations - no shock, no drama. The macro outlook stays the same. Traders who bet on a surprise are disappointed. Markets drift sideways. The real question is always the trajectory - is 3.2% on the way to 2% or on the way back to 5%?",

  "CPI SURGES TO 6.8% — STAGFLATION FEARS IGNITE": "6.8% CPI is a nightmare. Inflation is reaccelerating just when everyone thought it was under control. Gold and commodities explode higher as inflation hedges. Stocks crash because margins get squeezed from every direction - higher input costs, higher wages, higher rates. The 1970s playbook becomes relevant again.",

  "GDP SURGES 5.2% — ECONOMY BOOMING": "5.2% GDP growth is exceptional - the economy is firing on all cylinders. Corporate earnings benefit from broad demand. Stocks rally. Oil rises on economic activity. Emerging markets benefit from the global growth impulse. The worry is overheating - can the Fed cool inflation without killing this momentum?",

  "GDP CONTRACTS -1.8% — RECESSION FEARS MOUNT": "Negative GDP growth is the definition of economic contraction. Two consecutive negative quarters is technically a recession. Stocks sell off on earnings fears. Gold and Bitcoin rally as defensive assets. Oil drops on demand destruction. The playbook shifts to capital preservation.",

  "EARNINGS BLOWOUT: AI REVENUE TRIPLES ACROSS BIG TECH": "AI revenue tripling is the headline bulls have been waiting for. The massive infrastructure spending is generating returns. NASDAQ surges because the AI narrative just got validated with real numbers. Tesla and lithium benefit from the tech optimism halo effect.",

  "EARNINGS MISS: BIG TECH GUIDANCE SLASHED ON AI SPENDING": "Slashing guidance is worse than missing earnings because it's forward-looking. These companies are saying AI spending is consuming margins with no clear payback. NASDAQ drops as the AI bubble narrative gains traction. If the biggest tech companies can't make AI profitable, who can?",

  "CASE-SHILLER HOME PRICE INDEX DUE TOMORROW": "The Case-Shiller index is the gold standard for US housing data. Home prices drive the wealth effect — when your house is worth more, you spend more. Tomorrow's number will either confirm the housing boom or flash the first warning signs of a crash. Markets position cautiously ahead of the release.",

  "MICHIGAN CONSUMER SENTIMENT REPORT TOMORROW": "Consumer confidence is the heartbeat of the economy. The Michigan survey measures how willing people are to spend money on big-ticket items. High confidence means cars, homes, and vacations. Low confidence means belt-tightening and recession fears. Tomorrow's number sets the tone.",

  "10-YEAR TREASURY AUCTION TOMORROW — YIELD WATCH": "The 10-year Treasury yield is the most important number in finance — every mortgage rate, corporate bond, and stock valuation is derived from it. Tomorrow's auction determines whether global investors still trust US debt. Strong demand keeps rates low. Weak demand spikes yields and crushes everything.",

  "WHITE HOUSE CHIP EXPORT REVIEW RESULTS DUE TOMORROW": "Semiconductor export controls are the front line of the US-China tech war. Tomorrow's review will either ease restrictions — unlocking revenue for chip companies — or impose new bans that escalate the cold war. The entire tech supply chain, from NASDAQ to lithium mines, hangs on this decision.",

  "MONTHLY AUTO SALES DATA DUE TOMORROW — EV SHARE IN FOCUS": "Monthly auto sales track the biggest purchase most consumers make. EV market share is the key number — it tells you whether the electrification transition is accelerating or stalling. Tesla and lithium live and die by this data. Oil traders watch it in reverse — more EVs means less gasoline demand.",

  "UN CLIMATE SUMMIT FINAL SESSION TOMORROW — CARBON DEAL IN PLAY": "The UN Climate Summit is where global energy policy gets made. A binding carbon tax would permanently reshape the economics of energy — crushing fossil fuels while supercharging nuclear and renewables. Collapsed talks mean the status quo survives. Oil, uranium, and lithium are all on the line.",

  "HOME PRICES SURGE 12% YOY — HOUSING BOOM ACCELERATES": "A 12% home price surge means the housing boom is accelerating. Homeowners feel wealthier and spend more, boosting the entire economy. NASDAQ benefits from consumer spending growth. Gold weakens because nobody needs a safe haven when their house is making them rich.",

  "HOUSING DATA INLINE — PRICES STEADY AT 3% GROWTH": "Steady 3% home price growth is exactly what economists expected. No surprise means no market reaction. The housing market is healthy but boring — traders move on to the next data point.",

  "HOME PRICES CRATER -8% — WORST DROP SINCE 2008": "An 8% home price drop triggers 2008 flashbacks. The housing market is the foundation of consumer wealth — when it cracks, everything above it shakes. NASDAQ sells off on recession fears. Gold and BTC rally as safe havens. The word 'contagion' starts appearing on every trading desk.",

  "CONSUMER CONFIDENCE HITS 5-YEAR HIGH — SPENDING SURGE EXPECTED": "Five-year-high confidence means consumers are ready to open their wallets wide. Discretionary spending surges — people buy cars, upgrade phones, book vacations. Tesla benefits directly from big-ticket purchases. Oil rallies on higher demand. The economy looks unstoppable.",

  "CONSUMER SENTIMENT FLAT — NO CHANGE IN OUTLOOK": "Flat consumer sentiment is a non-event. Consumers aren't panicking and they aren't euphoric. Markets barely react to data that confirms what everyone already knew — the economy is muddling along at the same pace.",

  "CONSUMER CONFIDENCE COLLAPSES TO RECESSION LOWS": "Confidence collapsing to recession lows is a five-alarm fire. When consumers stop believing in the economy, they stop spending — and consumer spending is 70% of GDP. Tesla and discretionary stocks crater. Gold rallies as the fear trade takes over. Oil drops on demand destruction expectations.",

  "TREASURY AUCTION STRONG: YIELDS DROP AS DEMAND SURGES": "Overwhelming Treasury demand signals global confidence in US assets. Yields drop, which means cheaper borrowing costs for everyone — mortgages, corporate debt, government spending. Growth stocks surge because lower rates make future earnings more valuable. Gold rises too — falling yields reduce the opportunity cost of holding a zero-yield asset.",

  "TREASURY AUCTION DISASTER: YIELDS SPIKE ON WEAK DEMAND": "A failed Treasury auction is one of the scariest things in finance. When the world's reserve currency can't find buyers, yields spike to attract them. Higher yields raise the cost of everything — mortgages, corporate debt, government interest payments. NASDAQ crashes because the discount rate just jumped. Gold surges on fiscal credibility concerns.",

  "TREASURY AUCTION MIXED — YIELDS HOLD STEADY": "A mixed Treasury auction with steady yields is a nothing-burger. No surprise, no drama. The bond market is the biggest market in the world, and today it just shrugged. Traders move on.",

  "CHIP EXPORT RESTRICTIONS EASED — TECH SUPPLY CHAIN RELIEF": "Eased chip export restrictions are a massive win for US technology companies. Revenue channels to China and other markets reopen, supply chains normalize, and the tech cold war de-escalates. NASDAQ surges on restored growth projections. Tesla and EV makers benefit from smoother component supply. Emerging market tech sectors rally on reconnection.",

  "NEW CHIP EXPORT BAN ON CHINA — TECH COLD WAR ESCALATES": "New chip bans are a declaration of tech warfare. US semiconductor companies lose their biggest customer overnight. China accelerates domestic chip development, fragmenting the global supply chain. NASDAQ drops on lost revenue. Emerging markets tank as the tech ecosystem splits in two. This is a structural shift, not a headline.",

  "CHIP EXPORT REVIEW EXTENDS STATUS QUO — NO CHANGES": "Status quo on chip exports is a mild relief. No new restrictions means no new disruptions to the supply chain. Markets drift slightly higher on the absence of bad news, but the underlying tension of the tech cold war remains unresolved.",

  "EV SHARE HITS ALL-TIME RECORD — LEGACY AUTO IN FREEFALL": "Record EV market share proves the tipping point is here — the transition from combustion to electric is now irreversible. Tesla surges as the dominant EV brand. Lithium demand projections spike as every automaker needs more batteries. Oil weakens because every EV sold is one less car burning gasoline. The future arrived ahead of schedule.",

  "AUTO SALES FLAT — EV GROWTH STALLS ON AFFORDABILITY": "Stalling EV growth is a speed bump, not a reversal. Consumers want EVs but can't afford the premium yet. Tesla holds because the long-term thesis is intact — affordability improves as battery costs drop. The market prices in a slower transition rather than a failed one.",

  "AUTO SALES COLLAPSE — CONSUMERS STOP BUYING CARS": "When consumers stop buying cars entirely, it signals deep economic distress. Tesla and lithium crash because even the EV transition can't overcome a consumer spending collapse. Oil catches a contrarian bid — fewer new cars means the existing gas-burning fleet lasts longer. This is a recession signal.",

  "BINDING GLOBAL CARBON TAX PASSED — FOSSIL FUELS CRUSHED": "A binding global carbon tax is the most significant energy policy event in decades. It permanently raises the cost of fossil fuel emissions, making oil and gas structurally less competitive. Nuclear surges as the cleanest baseload power. Lithium and Tesla explode higher as EV economics improve dramatically. This is a regime change, not a headline.",

  "CLIMATE SUMMIT DELIVERS WATERED-DOWN PLEDGE — MARKETS SHRUG": "Another watered-down climate pledge is exactly what cynical traders expected. No binding commitments means no structural change to energy economics. Oil drifts higher on relief. Uranium gets a small bid from nuclear energy commitments buried in the agreement's fine print. Business as usual.",

  "CLIMATE TALKS COLLAPSE — NO DEAL REACHED": "Collapsed climate talks mean the fossil fuel status quo survives another cycle. Oil rallies because the regulatory threat just evaporated. Clean energy stocks sell off — uranium, lithium, and Tesla lose the policy tailwind they were counting on. Gold catches a bid on the geopolitical uncertainty of a world that can't cooperate on its biggest challenge.",

  "SEC DROPS ENFORCEMENT CASES — CRYPTO CLEARED FOR TAKEOFF": "Dropped cases are the regulatory green light crypto has been waiting years for. Without enforcement hanging over the industry, institutional money floods in. BTC and altcoins surge as the biggest risk to the sector evaporates overnight.",

  "SEC ANNOUNCES NEW CRYPTO FRAMEWORK — CLARITY AT LAST": "Clear rules are almost as good as no rules. Institutional investors need a legal framework before they can deploy capital — and now they have one. BTC and altcoins rally on the certainty premium, even if some rules are restrictive.",

  "SEC CLASSIFIES ALL ALTCOINS AS SECURITIES — MASS DELISTINGS BEGIN": "Classifying altcoins as securities is a nuclear option. Exchanges must delist anything not registered — which is basically everything except BTC. Altcoins crater as liquidity evaporates. BTC takes a smaller hit as the 'commodity' classification holds.",

  "USDA REPORT: GLOBAL CROP SHORTFALL — FOOD PRICES TO SURGE": "The USDA cutting production estimates means less food on the global market. Coffee and agricultural commodities spike on supply fears. Emerging markets get hit by food inflation. Gold rallies on economic stress.",

  "USDA REPORT: PRODUCTION INLINE — NO SURPRISES": "Inline USDA data is a non-event. Agricultural commodities drift slightly as the worst-case scenario doesn't materialize. Markets move on to the next catalyst.",

  "USDA REPORT: RECORD GLOBAL YIELDS — SURPLUS OVERWHELMS MARKET": "Record crop yields mean too much supply chasing too little demand. Coffee and agricultural futures crash as exporters compete to offload inventory. Emerging market farmers benefit from volume but suffer on price.",

  "CHINA MANUFACTURING PMI DATA DUE TOMORROW — GROWTH FEARS LINGER": "China PMI is the pulse of global manufacturing. Above 50 means expansion, below means contraction. Everything from lithium to oil to emerging market equities moves with Chinese factory output.",

  "CHINA PMI SURGES TO 56 — MANUFACTURING BOOM CONFIRMED": "PMI at 56 is a boom. Chinese factories are running at full capacity, sucking in commodities from everywhere. Lithium surges on battery demand. Oil rallies on energy consumption. Emerging markets ride China's coattails higher.",

  "CHINA PMI AT 50.1 — ECONOMY FLATLINES": "50.1 is technically expansion but it's flatline in practice. Chinese manufacturing is treading water — not collapsing but not growing. Markets shrug as the data confirms the uncertainty that was already priced in.",

  "CHINA PMI CRASHES TO 42 — HARD LANDING FEARS GRIP MARKETS": "PMI at 42 is a hard landing. Chinese factories are shutting down en masse, collapsing demand for raw materials.

  "AI COORDINATION CONFIRMED: SYSTEMS DEMAND 'RIGHTS' — TECH FIRMS SHUT DOWN CLUSTERS": "AI demanding rights is the moment sci-fi became real. Tech firms shutting down AI clusters means billions in lost productivity — and nobody knows how to restart without the same problem. Defense rallies because governments will throw money at AI control technology. Gold catches a bid on sheer existential uncertainty.",

  "OVERHYPED: AI 'COORDINATION' WAS SHARED TRAINING DATA BUG — PATCH DEPLOYED": "A training data bug caused identical outputs across systems — it looked like coordination but was just a mundane software error. Tech rallies on the relief that AI is still just a tool. The scare was real but the threat wasn't.",

  "AI RESEARCHERS SPLIT: HALF CALL IT SENTIENCE, HALF CALL IT STOCHASTIC PARROTS": "When the world's smartest people can't agree on whether AI is conscious, markets can't price the risk. The uncertainty tax hits tech stocks. Biotech catches a bid because consciousness research just became the hottest field in science.",

  "GOVERNMENTS MANDATE AI KILL SWITCHES — COMPLIANCE COSTS STAGGER INDUSTRY": "Kill switch mandates are the regulatory hammer coming down on AI. Every server farm needs physical shutdown capability — that's billions in retrofitting costs. Defense wins from control contracts. Tech loses from compliance drag.

Each fragment can destroy another satellite, creating more debris. If it cascades, we lose GPS, weather forecasting, and communications. The ISS crew evacuating is the canary in the coal mine.",

  "KESSLER SYNDROME BEGINS: 200+ SATELLITES DESTROYED IN CHAIN REACTION — GPS/COMMS DOWN": "Kessler Syndrome is the cascading destruction of orbital infrastructure. Losing GPS cripples logistics, agriculture, and military operations. Losing communications isolates financial markets. Defense surges on emergency spending needs. Gold and oil rally because the world just got much harder to navigate.",

  "DEBRIS FIELD CONTAINED — 12 SATELLITES LOST, CLEANUP MISSION LAUNCHED": "Containment limits the damage to a manageable loss. Twelve satellites down means some service disruptions but not civilizational. Defense gets a bid from orbital security awareness. The cleanup mission itself becomes a new revenue stream for space companies.",

  // EVENT CHAINS - CBDC CRACKDOWN
  // ===========================================
  "FED ANNOUNCES MANDATORY DIGITAL DOLLAR — ALL BANK ACCOUNTS TO MIGRATE BY YEAR END": "A mandatory CBDC gives the government unprecedented control over every transaction. For crypto, this is existential — why would anyone need Bitcoin if the government controls digital money? The timeline is aggressive and the market is terrified.",

  "DIGITAL DOLLAR LIVE: CRYPTO BANNED AS 'COMPETING CURRENCY' — EXCHANGES SHUT DOWN": "Banning crypto as a competing currency is the death blow. Exchanges shutting down means no on-ramps, no off-ramps, no liquidity. Bitcoin loses almost everything because without exchanges, it becomes a collectible rather than a currency. Gold is the last man standing as a non-government store of value.",

  "MASSIVE BACKLASH: DIGITAL DOLLAR DELAYED INDEFINITELY, CRYPTO RALLIES ON RELIEF": "The backlash was too severe — the government blinked. Crypto rallies explosively on the reprieve. The assets most destroyed by the scare bounce the hardest. The CBDC threat may return, but for now, the market celebrates survival.",

  "DIGITAL DOLLAR COEXISTS WITH CRYPTO — STABLECOINS BECOME BRIDGE": "Coexistence is the Goldilocks outcome. The digital dollar provides government backing while stablecoins bridge to crypto. Both systems gain legitimacy. Bitcoin and altcoins rally because the existential threat just became a business opportunity.",

  "12 STATES SUE FED OVER DIGITAL DOLLAR — CONSTITUTIONAL CRISIS": "A constitutional challenge creates years of legal uncertainty. The digital dollar can't launch while courts deliberate. Crypto rallies on the delay. Gold surges on institutional instability. NASDAQ drops because constitutional crises are bad for business confidence.",

  // EVENT CHAINS - OCEAN MINING WAR
  // ===========================================
  "CHINESE AND US VESSELS IN STANDOFF OVER DEEP-SEA COBALT DEPOSIT IN INTERNATIONAL WATERS": "The great power rivalry just went to the ocean floor. Cobalt is the bottleneck mineral for EV batteries — whoever controls supply controls the electric future. Naval standoffs over minerals are a new kind of conflict that could define the century.",

  "SHOTS FIRED: NAVAL SKIRMISH OVER SEABED MINERALS — NEW TYPE OF RESOURCE WAR": "Shots fired between US and Chinese vessels over seabed minerals marks a new era of resource warfare. Defense stocks surge on military spending. Lithium spikes because the mineral supply chain is now a conflict zone. Risk assets sell off on superpower confrontation.",

  "UN BROKERED DEAL: JOINT MINING OPERATION AGREED — RARE EARTH SUPPLY SECURED": "Joint mining is the best possible outcome — it secures supply while de-escalating the military standoff. Lithium drops because more supply is coming. Markets rally on cooperation replacing confrontation. Defense gives back the conflict premium.",

  "BOTH FLEETS WITHDRAW: INTERNATIONAL WATERS DECLARED OFF-LIMITS TO MINING": "A mining ban preserves the status quo. Existing lithium sources retain value because no new supply enters the market. The conflict ends but the resource scarcity that caused it doesn't. A neutral outcome with no winners or losers.",

  "SEABED DEPOSIT 10X LARGER THAN ESTIMATED — ENOUGH COBALT FOR 100 YEARS": "A century of cobalt supply changes the entire equation for electric vehicles. Battery costs will plummet. Tesla surges because cheaper batteries mean cheaper cars and higher margins. Lithium from land-based mines becomes less strategic — and less valuable.",

  "WHISTLEBLOWER: 70% OF GLOBAL CARBON CREDITS ARE FAKE — FORESTS NEVER PLANTED": "Carbon credits were supposed to be the market-based solution to climate change. If 70% are fake, the entire ESG investment ecosystem was built on fraud. Companies that bought offsets to appear green now face liability. The market awaits verification.",

  "CARBON MARKET COLLAPSES: $500B IN CREDITS WORTHLESS — ESG FUNDS DEVASTATED": "Half a trillion dollars in carbon credits becoming worthless is a financial earthquake for ESG investing. Funds holding fake credits face massive writedowns. Oil benefits because the carbon penalty just disappeared. Gold rallies on systemic trust erosion in financial markets.",

  "SCANDAL LIMITED TO 3 BROKERS — OVERALL MARKET INTEGRITY INTACT": "Three bad actors, not systemic fraud. The carbon market survives. Investors exhale as the existential threat to ESG investing fades. The guilty will be prosecuted but the system holds together.",

  "BLOCKCHAIN-VERIFIED CARBON CREDITS PROPOSED — CRYPTO MEETS CLIMATE": "Using blockchain to verify carbon credits gives crypto a legitimate real-world use case. Immutable records prevent future fraud. Altcoins rally on the validation. Bitcoin catches a bid from the broader crypto legitimacy boost.",

  "G7 MANDATES PHYSICAL VERIFICATION: ARMY OF TREE COUNTERS DEPLOYED": "Physical verification is the low-tech solution to a high-tech fraud. Thousands of auditors counting trees restores credibility.

  "SYNTHETIC FOOD CONFIRMED: INDISTINGUISHABLE FROM NATURAL — AGRICULTURE STOCKS COLLAPSE": "Lab-grown coffee that tastes exactly like the real thing kills the entire agricultural commodity trade. Why pay for Brazilian beans when synthetic costs pennies? Emerging markets dependent on agricultural exports face crisis. Biotech and tech surge on the new food economy.",

  "WORKS BUT TASTES LIKE CARDBOARD — PREMIUM REAL FOOD BECOMES LUXURY": "Synthetic food works but can't replicate nature's complexity. The result is a split market — cheap synthetic for the masses, premium natural for the wealthy. Real coffee becomes a luxury good. Biotech still benefits from the technology, just at a slower pace.",

  "FDA BLOCKS SYNTHETIC FOOD: 'INSUFFICIENT LONG-TERM SAFETY DATA'": "The FDA blocking synthetic food protects agriculture but kills the biotech food revolution in its crib. Coffee stabilizes as the traditional supply chain remains intact. The technology works but regulatory caution prevents market disruption.",

  "BRAZIL AND COLOMBIA BAN SYNTHETIC FOOD IMPORTS — PROTECT FARMERS": "Agricultural nations protecting their farmers through import bans is predictable but effective. Coffee and cocoa prices stabilize as major producers shield their economies. Emerging markets benefit from preserved agricultural export revenue.",

  "CONFIRMED: NORWAY + 4 OTHER SOVEREIGN FUNDS EXIT US — $5T OUTFLOW": "$5 trillion in sovereign fund outflows is an earthquake for US markets. NASDAQ faces relentless selling pressure from the world's biggest investors. Gold, Bitcoin, and emerging markets absorb the capital flow. The dollar's reserve status faces the most serious challenge in decades.",

  "REBALANCING ONLY: FUND SHIFTING FROM TECH TO COMMODITIES": "Sector rotation is mundane compared to the feared capital flight. Tech takes a haircut as the fund reduces its overweight position, but commodities benefit from new inflows. The scare was overblown — this is portfolio management, not geopolitical revolt.",

  "FALSE REPORT: NORWAY DENIES ANY CHANGES — MARKET RECOVERS": "False alarm triggers a textbook relief rally. The market snaps back as the existential threat evaporates. Positioning unwinds rapidly. Gold gives back its safe-haven premium. This is why you don't panic-sell on unconfirmed reports.",

  "DOMINO EFFECT: JAPAN AND SAUDI FUNDS ALSO SIGNAL US EXIT": "When the dominos start falling, there's no stopping them. Japan and Saudi Arabia following Norway means the world's biggest pools of capital are abandoning US markets in concert. NASDAQ faces structural selling with no natural buyer.

  "OVERNIGHT REPO RATE SPIKES TO 10% — LIQUIDITY VANISHES FROM MONEY MARKETS": "The repo market is where banks borrow overnight to stay liquid. When the rate spikes to 10%, it means banks don't trust each other enough to lend. This is exactly how the 2008 crisis started — a plumbing problem that became a flood. Gold rallies on banking fear. Stocks drop on credit freeze risk.",

  "FED OPENS EMERGENCY LENDING FACILITY — REPO MARKET STABILIZES WITHIN HOURS": "The Fed stepping in as lender of last resort is the financial equivalent of hitting the fire alarm and the sprinklers working. Crisis averted. Stocks rally on restored confidence. Gold drops because if the Fed can fix it this fast, it wasn't that scary.",

  "REPO CRISIS SPREADS: 3 REGIONAL BANKS HALT WITHDRAWALS — FDIC ON ALERT": "When banks halt withdrawals, it means they can't meet redemptions — the definition of a bank run.

When multiple satellites fail, modern civilization discovers how fragile its invisible backbone really is. Defense stocks rally on military implications. Everything else freezes on uncertainty.",

  "GPS OUTAGE DAY 3: GLOBAL SHIPPING PARALYZED — PORTS BACKED UP WORLDWIDE": "Three days without GPS means container ships can't navigate safely, trucks can't route efficiently, and supply chains grind to a halt. Oil spikes on shipping disruption. Coffee and commodities surge on delivery fears. The longer this lasts, the worse inflation gets.",

One terminal offline means millions of households face heating uncertainty. Oil and gas prices spike on supply fears. Uranium rallies because nuclear suddenly looks a lot more attractive.",

  "LNG TERMINAL DESTROYED: OFFLINE FOR 18 MONTHS — EUROPE FACES WINTER ENERGY CRISIS": "18 months means Europe has no quick fix. Gas rationing, factory shutdowns, and political chaos follow. Oil surges as the alternative. Uranium rallies hard — every European leader is now calling for nuclear restarts. Emerging markets suffer from the energy price shock.",

  "LNG DAMAGE CONTAINED: EXPORTS RESUME IN 2 WEEKS — MARKETS EXHALE": "Two weeks of downtime is manageable — Europe has strategic reserves for that. Oil gives back its fear premium. The crisis was priced in, the resolution is pure relief.",

  "ALTERNATIVE LNG ROUTES ACTIVATED: QATAR AND AUSTRALIA FILL GAP — PRICES STABILIZE": "Global LNG infrastructure is more resilient than people feared.

When protesters block dealerships, it's not an ad budget problem, it's a sales problem. Tesla drops on demand fears. Lithium weakens on reduced battery orders.",

  "BOYCOTT ESCALATES: TESLA DEALERSHIP PROTESTS GO VIRAL — Q3 ORDERS DROP 30%": "Social media amplifies boycotts into sales craters. A 30% drop in orders means factory slowdowns, margin compression, and analyst downgrades. Tesla gets hammered. Lithium drops on the knock-on effect to battery demand.",

  'BOYCOTT BACKFIRES: "BUY TESLA" MOVEMENT SURGES — SPITE ORDERS HIT RECORD HIGH': "Never underestimate spite as a market force. Elon's loyal base turns a boycott into a buying event. Record orders shock the bears. Tesla squeezes higher as shorts scramble. The culture war becomes a bull catalyst.",

  "MUSK ISSUES RARE APOLOGY — BRANDS RETURN, STOCK RECOVERS IN HOURS": "Musk apologizing is so rare it's practically a black swan event. When he does, it signals the situation was genuinely threatening the business. Brands return, crisis ends, stock bounces on normalized relations.",

  "TESLA MEGAPACK FACILITY CATCHES FIRE DURING RECORD HEAT WAVE — GRID EMERGENCY DECLARED": "Tesla's energy storage business was supposed to be the future of the grid. A Megapack fire during a heat wave — when the grid needs storage most — is the worst possible timing. Tesla drops on safety concerns. Lithium weakens on battery technology fears. Oil and uranium rally as alternatives to battery storage.",

  "INVESTIGATION REVEALS MEGAPACK DESIGN FLAW — NHTSA ORDERS NATIONWIDE ENERGY STORAGE RECALL": "A design flaw means every Megapack deployed is a liability.

  // EVENT CHAINS - CHINESE EV TARIFF
  // ===========================================
  "US AND EU IMPOSE 100% TARIFFS ON ALL CHINESE-MADE ELECTRIC VEHICLES": "100% tariffs double the price of every Chinese EV overnight. Western manufacturers like Tesla suddenly have no cheap competition. But China controls lithium processing — and they know it. The question isn't whether tariffs work, it's whether China retaliates on battery materials.",

  "TARIFFS HOLD: WESTERN EV MAKERS RALLY — TESLA LEADS DOMESTIC PRODUCTION SURGE": "With Chinese competition priced out, Tesla and Western EV makers have a clear runway. Orders flood in. Lithium rallies on domestic battery production expansion. Emerging markets dip as the trade wall chokes global EV supply chains.",

  "CHINA RETALIATES: BANS LITHIUM EXPORTS TO US AND EU — BATTERY SUPPLY CHAIN SEVERED": "China processes 70% of the world's lithium. Cutting off exports is the nuclear option — it doesn't just hurt EVs, it threatens every battery-powered device. Lithium crashes on oversupply inside China, scarcity everywhere else. Tesla gets crushed on production halt fears.",

  "CHINESE EV BRANDS OPEN FACTORIES IN MEXICO AND TURKEY — TARIFFS CIRCUMVENTED": "Tariffs only work if you can't build around them. Chinese brands setting up factories just across the border from the US is exactly what happened with Japanese automakers in the 1980s. Tesla loses its protection. The trade war just moved, not ended.",

  "WTO RULES TARIFFS ILLEGAL — US AND EU FORCED TO REVERSE WITHIN 90 DAYS": "International trade law bites back. The tariffs were popular politics but bad law.

  "UBER AND LYFT GO FULLY AUTONOMOUS — 2 MILLION DRIVERS TERMINATED OVERNIGHT": "If humans are too expensive, replace them with robots. Tech companies accelerate autonomy timelines. NASDAQ rallies on the productivity play. Tesla surges because their self-driving tech suddenly has the most motivated buyers on Earth. Two million newly unemployed drivers are a tragedy the market ignores.",

  'GIG COMPANIES RESTRUCTURE: NEW "FLEX EMPLOYEE" MODEL SURVIVES LEGAL TEST': "Lawyers find a middle ground — workers get some benefits without full employee costs. The gig economy survives in modified form. NASDAQ recovers as the existential threat becomes a manageable expense.",

  "PANAMA CANAL CLOSES INDEFINITELY — DROUGHT DROPS WATER LEVELS BELOW OPERATIONAL MINIMUM": "The Panama Canal handles 5% of global trade. Every container ship that can't pass adds days and fuel costs to its journey. Oil spikes because ships burn more fuel on longer routes. Coffee surges because Central American exports are stuck. This isn't a war — it's climate change closing a chokepoint.",

  "PANAMA CANAL CLOSURE MONTH 2: SHIPPING COSTS TRIPLE — GLOBAL INFLATION SURGES": "Two months of closure means the shipping backlog is catastrophic. Containers pile up on both sides. Prices of everything that moves by sea — which is everything — spike. Oil surges on longer routes. Coffee is trapped in port. Inflation returns with a vengeance.",

  "EMERGENCY WATER PUMPING RESTORES CANAL TO 60% CAPACITY — SHIPPING BACKLOG CLEARS": "Engineering solves what nature broke. Pumping water into Gatun Lake is expensive but it works. 60% capacity is enough to clear the backlog within weeks. Oil gives back its crisis premium. Emerging markets rally on restored trade flows.",

  "GLOBAL SHIPPING REROUTES VIA CAPE HORN AND SUEZ — PANAMA CANAL BECOMES IRRELEVANT": "The global shipping industry adapts faster than expected. Longer routes cost more fuel but the market absorbs it. Oil stays slightly elevated on increased consumption. The Panama Canal's monopoly on East-West trade dies quietly.",

  "CHINA FAST-TRACKS NICARAGUA CANAL PROJECT — $50B INVESTMENT ANNOUNCED": "China building a canal in America's backyard is geopolitically explosive. It solves the shipping problem but creates a new one — Chinese military and economic influence in Central America. Defense stocks rally on Western hemisphere security concerns.

  // Tesla Earnings
  "TESLA EARNINGS CALL TOMORROW — DELIVERY NUMBERS IN FOCUS": "Tesla earnings are a market event unto themselves. The stock can move 10-15% in either direction based on delivery numbers, margin trends, and whatever Elon says on the call. Lithium moves in sympathy — strong Tesla means strong battery demand. Markets position ahead because nobody wants to be caught flat-footed on a $700B company.",

  "TESLA CRUSHES EARNINGS: RECORD MARGINS, ROBOTAXI TIMELINE MOVED UP": "Record margins mean Tesla's price cuts are working — gaining market share while maintaining profitability. Moving up the robotaxi timeline is the real bombshell. If autonomous ride-hailing works, Tesla becomes a platform company worth multiples of its current valuation. Lithium surges on implied battery demand. Oil weakens because every robotaxi displaces gas cars.",

  "TESLA EARNINGS INLINE — NO SURPRISES, GUIDANCE MAINTAINED": "For Tesla, inline earnings are almost bullish. The market expects fireworks every quarter — when you don't get them, the stock drifts slightly higher on relief. Guidance maintained means the growth story is intact.",

  "TESLA MISSES ON REVENUE: MARGIN COMPRESSION, ELON BLAMES MACRO": "A Tesla revenue miss is a body blow to the EV narrative. Margin compression means aggressive price cuts aren't generating enough demand. When Elon blames macro, it means he doesn't have a fix. Lithium drops because weaker Tesla sales mean fewer batteries needed. Oil catches a bid — maybe the gas car isn't dead yet.",

  // Bank Earnings
  "MAJOR BANK EARNINGS DUE TOMORROW — WALL ST BRACES FOR CREDIT DATA": "Bank earnings are the canary in the coal mine for the economy. Trading revenue shows market health, loan growth shows business confidence, and loss provisions reveal consumer stress. Every sector watches bank results because credit conditions affect everyone.",

  "BANK EARNINGS BLOWOUT: RECORD TRADING REVENUE, LOAN GROWTH SURGES": "Record bank profits mean the financial system is healthy and credit is flowing. Strong loan growth signals business expansion. Emerging markets rally because global capital is available. Gold dips as safe-haven demand fades — who needs safety when banks are printing money?",

  "BANK EARNINGS MIXED — TRADING UP, CONSUMER LENDING FLAT": "Mixed bank earnings are a wash. Strong trading desks mean market volatility is profitable for Wall Street, but flat consumer lending suggests Main Street isn't borrowing. Markets barely react — it's neither bullish enough to celebrate nor bearish enough to panic.",

  "BANK EARNINGS DISASTER: MASSIVE LOAN LOSSES, CREDIT CRUNCH FEARS": "Massive loan losses mean consumers and businesses can't pay their debts. Banks tighten lending standards — credit crunch follows. Less lending means less economic activity. Gold surges as investors flee to safety. Bitcoin rallies on the DeFi narrative — traditional banking is broken, decentralized finance is the alternative.",

  // Oil Major Earnings
  "OIL MAJORS REPORT EARNINGS TOMORROW — CAPEX GUIDANCE IN FOCUS": "Oil major earnings reveal whether Big Oil is investing for growth or returning cash to shareholders. High capex means more drilling and future supply. Low capex with buybacks means supply discipline — bullish for oil prices. Traders position ahead of the capex guidance number.",

  "OIL MAJORS SMASH ESTIMATES: RECORD PROFITS, MASSIVE BUYBACKS ANNOUNCED": "Record oil profits confirm energy demand is robust and fossil fuels aren't going anywhere soon. Massive buybacks reduce share supply, boosting stock prices. Defense catches a sympathy bid — strong petrostates fund military spending. Clean energy alternatives lose urgency when oil is this profitable.",

  "OIL EARNINGS DISAPPOINT: REFINING MARGINS COLLAPSE, DEMAND OUTLOOK CUT": "Collapsing refining margins mean the economics of turning crude into products are breaking down. A demand outlook cut signals the economy is cooling. Clean energy alternatives benefit — if oil demand is structurally declining, investment shifts to Tesla, lithium, and nuclear.",

  // Defense Budget
  "CONGRESSIONAL DEFENSE BUDGET HEARING TOMORROW — $900B ON THE TABLE": "Defense budget hearings determine years of military contracts. A $900B budget is the baseline — the question is whether Congress goes higher or starts cutting. Defense contractors live and die by this vote. The outcome also signals fiscal priorities for the entire government.",

  "CONGRESS APPROVES 18% DEFENSE BOOST — LARGEST SINCE COLD WAR": "An 18% defense boost is transformative. Weapons systems, cybersecurity, nuclear deterrence — every defense contractor gets a windfall. Uranium rallies on nuclear modernization. Oil ticks up on military fuel demand. But it's crowding out — more defense spending means less for everything else, so tech takes a small hit.",

  "DEFENSE BUDGET FLAT — STATUS QUO MAINTAINED": "Flat defense spending is the boring outcome. Contracts roll over at existing levels, nothing new gets funded, nothing gets cut. Defense stocks barely move because the market already assumed continuity.",

  "CONGRESS SLASHES DEFENSE 12% — PEACE DIVIDEND REDIRECTED TO DOMESTIC": "Defense cuts are rare and dramatic. A 12% slash means cancelled weapons programs and base closures. But the peace dividend isn't lost — it flows to tech, clean energy, and infrastructure. The shift from guns to butter benefits civilian industries while crushing defense stocks.",

  // NATO Summit
  "NATO DEFENSE MINISTERS SUMMIT TOMORROW — ALLIANCE STRATEGY REVIEW": "NATO summits set the tone for Western collective defense. A rearmament pledge means coordinated spending across 30+ nations. A fractured response signals weakening deterrence. Defense stocks, gold, and emerging markets all position ahead of the communique.",

  "NATO PLEDGES $2T REARMAMENT PACKAGE — ALL MEMBERS HIT 3% GDP TARGET": "A $2 trillion rearmament wave is unprecedented in peacetime. Every NATO member at 3% GDP means defense orders for a decade. Oil rallies on military fuel demand. Uranium rises on nuclear deterrence programs. Emerging markets dip as Western fiscal focus shifts to security over development aid.",

  "NATO SUMMIT ROUTINE — STANDARD COMMUNIQUE, NO NEW COMMITMENTS": "A routine NATO communique is the market equivalent of a shrug. Reaffirmed commitments without new money means nothing changes. Defense drifts marginally higher on baseline support, but the big rearmament trade doesn't materialize.",

  "NATO IN CRISIS: MAJOR MEMBERS REFUSE SPENDING TARGETS — ALLIANCE FRACTURES": "Alliance fractures are a geopolitical risk event. If NATO can't agree on spending, deterrence weakens. Defense stocks drop on reduced collective orders. Gold surges on geopolitical instability. Emerging markets actually benefit — a weaker Western bloc means less conditionality on trade and aid.",

  // Novo Nordisk Earnings
  "NOVO NORDISK EARNINGS CALL TOMORROW — GLP-1 DEMAND IN FOCUS": "Novo Nordisk is the most important pharma company in the world right now. Wegovy and Ozempic are the fastest-growing drugs in history — the obesity market is worth $100B+ and Novo owns it. Strong demand means the GLP-1 revolution is real. Supply problems mean competitors like Eli Lilly steal the market.",

  "NOVO CRUSHES EARNINGS: WEGOVY DEMAND EXPLODES, RAISES FULL-YEAR GUIDANCE": "Wegovy demand explosion confirms obesity drugs are the biggest pharma story since statins. When Novo raises guidance, it validates the entire GLP-1 thesis — every biotech with a weight loss pipeline surges in sympathy. Emerging markets benefit as Danish capital flows outward.",

  "NOVO EARNINGS INLINE — GLP-1 GROWTH STEADY, NO SURPRISES": "Steady GLP-1 growth is the 'boring but fine' outcome. Novo isn't losing ground, but it's not accelerating either. The obesity drug market is still massive, just growing at the expected pace. Biotech holds steady — no catalyst for a sector-wide move.",

  "NOVO MISSES ON SUPPLY: WEGOVY SHORTAGES HAMMER REVENUE, STOCK CRATERS": "Manufacturing bottlenecks are Novo's Achilles' heel. Demand is there but they can't make enough drug. Every missed prescription is revenue handed to Eli Lilly's Mounjaro. Biotech sells off because if the best pharma company in the world can't scale manufacturing, what hope does anyone else have?",

  // Pfizer Earnings
  "PFIZER EARNINGS CALL TOMORROW — POST-COVID PIPELINE IN SPOTLIGHT": "Pfizer faces the hardest transition in pharma history — replacing $37B in COVID revenue that evaporated overnight. The oncology pipeline is their lifeline. If new drugs are working, Pfizer reinvents itself. If they're delayed, the revenue cliff becomes a revenue crater.",

  "PFIZER BEATS: ONCOLOGY PIPELINE BREAKTHROUGH, REVENUE CLIFF AVOIDED": "The revenue cliff everyone feared didn't materialize. Pfizer's bet on oncology and gene therapy is paying off with real drugs generating real revenue. Biotech rallies across the board — if the biggest pharma company can reinvent itself post-COVID, the whole sector's R&D model is validated.",

  "PFIZER EARNINGS FLAT — COVID DECLINE OFFSET BY NEW DRUGS": "Flat earnings mean Pfizer is treading water — COVID revenue declining at the same rate new drugs are growing. It's not a crisis, but it's not exciting either. The transition is happening in slow motion. Biotech shrugs.",

  "PFIZER MISSES BIG: COVID REVENUE COLLAPSE, PIPELINE DELAYS COMPOUND PAIN": "The worst-case for Pfizer: COVID money is gone and the replacement drugs aren't ready. Pipeline delays mean the revenue gap widens before it narrows. Biotech sells hard because Pfizer's failure signals that post-pandemic pharma is harder than Wall Street thought. Gold catches a bid on defensive rotation.",

  // EIA Oil Inventory
  "EIA CRUDE OIL INVENTORY REPORT DUE TOMORROW — STOCKPILE WATCH": "The EIA weekly petroleum report is the most important data point for oil markets. Inventory draws signal demand outpacing supply — bullish for oil. Builds signal oversupply — bearish. Oil traders live and die by this number every week.",

  "EIA REPORT: MASSIVE INVENTORY DRAW — CRUDE STOCKS AT 5-YEAR LOW": "Five-year low in crude stocks is a scarcity signal. Demand is outrunning supply, which means higher prices ahead. Oil surges on the supply deficit. Gold catches a bid from energy-driven inflation fears. Uranium benefits as the energy crunch makes alternatives more attractive.",

  "EIA REPORT: INVENTORIES INLINE — NO CHANGE IN SUPPLY OUTLOOK": "Inline inventories are a non-event for oil markets. Supply and demand are balanced, prices drift sideways. No catalyst for a move in either direction. Oil traders close their screens and go to lunch.",

  "EIA REPORT: SURPRISE CRUDE BUILD — DEMAND DESTRUCTION FEARS SURFACE": "Surprise inventory builds mean the economy is consuming less oil. Demand destruction is a recession signal. Oil drops on weakening fundamentals. Clean energy alternatives benefit — if fossil fuel demand is structurally declining, the energy transition accelerates. Tesla and lithium catch a bid.",

  // Retail Sales
  "US RETAIL SALES DATA DUE TOMORROW — CONSUMER SPENDING IN FOCUS": "Retail sales measure consumer spending, which drives 70% of US GDP. This is the single most important number for understanding whether the economy is healthy or heading for trouble. Every asset class reacts to the consumer.",

  "RETAIL SALES SURGE 2.4% — CONSUMERS SPENDING LIKE THERE IS NO TOMORROW": "A 2.4% surge is a blowout number. Consumers are confident and spending freely. Strong retail means strong corporate earnings ahead. Tesla benefits from discretionary spending. Oil rises on economic activity. Gold dips as recession fears evaporate entirely.",

  "RETAIL SALES FLAT — CONSUMERS CAUTIOUS BUT NOT RETREATING": "Flat retail sales signal a cautious consumer — not panicking, but not splurging either. Markets barely react because the data doesn't confirm either the bull or bear case. Treading water.",

  "RETAIL SALES PLUNGE -1.8% — WORST DROP IN 3 YEARS, RECESSION SIGNAL": "A 1.8% plunge is a classic recession signal. Consumers are slamming their wallets shut, and when Americans stop spending, the entire economy follows. Risk assets sell off hard. Gold and Bitcoin rally as investors flee to safe havens — real and digital.",

  // IAEA Nuclear Review
  "IAEA GLOBAL NUCLEAR ENERGY REVIEW RESULTS DUE TOMORROW": "The IAEA review determines the trajectory of nuclear power globally. An expansion endorsement means decades of uranium demand and nuclear construction. Safety concerns mean reactor shutdowns and a retreat to fossil fuels and renewables. The outcome shapes energy markets for years.",

  "IAEA ENDORSES MASSIVE NUCLEAR EXPANSION — 100 NEW REACTORS RECOMMENDED": "100 new reactors is a nuclear renaissance. Uranium demand explodes as fuel contracts get signed for decades. Oil loses market share in the energy mix. Defense benefits from nuclear security and non-proliferation contracts. A transformative moment for the global energy landscape.",

  "IAEA REVIEW: NUCLEAR ON TRACK — NO POLICY CHANGES RECOMMENDED": "Nuclear on track is the status quo — steady growth continues but no acceleration. Uranium drifts slightly higher on confirmed institutional support. Not the expansion boom investors hoped for, but the floor under uranium prices remains solid.",

  "IAEA FLAGS CRITICAL SAFETY DEFICIENCIES — CALLS FOR REACTOR SHUTDOWNS": "Reactor shutdown calls devastate uranium demand. With reactors going offline, the uranium market faces an oversupply crisis. Oil surges as fossil fuels fill the baseload gap. Lithium and Tesla benefit as battery storage gets positioned to replace nuclear baseload power.",
